This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nextjs.org) project

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This sets up both the client and server with the powerful module `concurrently`

- Open the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the client side.
- Open the [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000) with your browser to see the server side.
